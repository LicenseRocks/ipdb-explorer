## IPDB Explorer

A simple react app for fetching transactions from [https://test.ipdb.io](https://test.ipdb.io) based on a public key and / or asset id.

The transactions can be viewed as a list or graph, and clicking on them reveals the transaction details.

Searching again adds the retrieved transactions to the list.

You can view it online at [https://ipdb-explorer.license.rocks](https://ipdb-explorer.license.rocks)
